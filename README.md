# **Sudoku Solver and Interactive Game with GUI**

A **Python-based Sudoku Solver and Game** that provides an interactive gameplay experience with AI-driven solutions. This project uses **Backtracking** and **Arc Consistency** algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently. Users can input puzzles, validate their entries, or watch the AI solve puzzles step-by-step.

---

## **1. Game Description**

**Sudoku** is a logic-based number-placement game. The objective is to complete a 9x9 grid such that:
- Each **row**, **column**, and **3x3 subgrid** contains all digits from `1 to 9`.
- Numbers cannot repeat in any row, column, or subgrid.

This project offers:
- **Interactive Sudoku gameplay** with real-time validation.
- An **AI Solver** that solves puzzles using **Backtracking** and **Arc Consistency**.
- The ability to generate random, solvable puzzles.

## **2. Features**

### **2.1 Game Modes**

- **Mode 1: AI Solver**
  - Watch the AI solve puzzles in real time using **Backtracking** or **Arc Consistency**.
  - Displays the solving process step-by-step in the GUI.

- **Mode 2: Interactive Sudoku**
  - Input custom puzzles using the interactive GUI.
  - Validate each entry for compliance with Sudoku rules.
  - Solve the puzzle automatically by clicking a button.

### **2.2 Algorithms**

#### **Backtracking**
- Recursively solves puzzles by trying all valid numbers for each empty cell.
- Backtracks when no valid placement is possible.
- Validates user-input puzzles for solvability.
- Generates random puzzles while ensuring they have solutions.

#### **Arc Consistency**
1. **Representation as a CSP**:
   - Each cell in the grid is a *variable*.
   - Each variable has a *domain* of possible values `[1â€“9]`.
   - Constraints ensure no repeated values in rows, columns, or subgrids.

2. **Defining Arcs**:
   - Arcs are binary constraints between connected variables:
     - All pairs of cells in the same row, column, or subgrid.

3. **Domain Reduction**:
   - Pre-filled cells have domains reduced to a single value.
   - Iteratively reduce the domains of other cells by enforcing constraints.

4. **Updating the Grid**:
   - Assign cells with singleton domains (only one possible value).

### **2.3 GUI Features**

- **Interactive Grid**:
  - Click on any cell to input numbers.
  - Invalid entries are highlighted with visual cues.

- **Buttons**:
  - **Solve Puzzle**: Lets the AI solve the puzzle step-by-step.
  - **Generate Puzzle**: Generates a random, solvable puzzle.

- **Real-Time Feedback**:
  - Ensures user inputs do not violate Sudoku rules.
